## 1. Introduction

Daylight is an inherently complex and dynamic resource that continuously shapes our built environment through its spectral composition, intensity, and directional structure. Accurate characterization of sky conditions underpins virtually every aspect of contemporary lighting research, from circadian-stimulus metrics and glare probability assessments to façade aperture sizing and adaptive shading algorithms. Without standardized methods for describing daylit skies, results from field studies, laboratory experiments, and computational simulations remain difficult to compare, aggregate, or apply in practice.

The Commission Internationale de l'Éclairage (CIE) has established comprehensive standards for sky classification, culminating in the fifteen-type CIE Standard General Sky (S 011/E:2003). While this system provides the theoretical foundation for photometric research, its practical implementation faces significant challenges. Translating real sky conditions into the five CIE coefficients requires sophisticated instrumentation and complex fitting procedures that are often unreliable with partial-view imagery or consumer-grade equipment. Consequently, most practical workflows collapse the fifteen-type system into simplified three-category classifications: clear, partial (partly cloudy), and overcast conditions.

This repository presents a comprehensive framework for daylit sky categorization using modern image processing techniques, explicitly designed to bridge the gap between CIE theoretical standards and practical implementation constraints. Our approach leverages three complementary methods to characterize sky conditions from standard digital imagery:

### Key Components

**Sky Image Descriptors (SID)**: A contrastive learning-based approach that extracts 16-dimensional representations capturing semantic sky characteristics. Using a ResNet50 backbone trained on carefully curated sky imagery, the SID model learns meaningful embeddings that naturally cluster similar sky conditions without explicit supervision.

**Cloud Coverage (CC) Estimation**: A U-Net architecture with ResNet50 encoder that performs pixel-level segmentation to quantify cloud coverage percentage. The model combines manual annotations with active learning using high-confidence pseudo-labels to achieve robust performance across diverse atmospheric conditions.

**Optical Flow Analysis**: Temporal motion analysis that captures dynamic characteristics of sky conditions by quantifying cloud movement patterns between consecutive video frames, providing insights into atmospheric dynamics impossible to obtain from static images alone.

### Research Contributions

This framework addresses four critical objectives in daylight research:

1. **Standardized Methodology**: Establishes a transparent, straightforward procedure using real-world scenes captured by standard digital cameras to convert image data into standardized, image-processing based parameters compatible with CIE principles.

2. **Broad Applicability**: Enables consistent comparisons across studies and laboratories, including those relying on partial-dome or façade views, without requiring specialized luminance measurement equipment.

3. **Modern Integration**: Presents a unified workflow that embraces contemporary camera technologies, HDR imaging, and deep learning approaches while remaining anchored to established CIE sky-type principles.

4. **Practical Implementation**: Broadens applications by adapting meteorological methodologies to concise, image-friendly metrics suitable for building-control systems, simulation studies, and post-occupancy evaluations.

By resolving ambiguities in parameter acquisition and offering a rigorously defined yet operationally lightweight alternative to full fifteen-type CIE classification, this work equips lighting researchers with a standardized, scalable, and CIE-compatible toolset for daylit-sky characterization. The framework is specifically designed to handle scenarios where traditional coefficient-fitting methods are impracticable while maintaining scientific rigor and reproducibility.

### Repository Structure

This repository provides complete implementations of all three sky descriptors, comprehensive datasets for training and evaluation, and detailed reproduction procedures for all experimental results. The modular design allows researchers to use individual components or the complete integrated pipeline depending on their specific requirements and available data types.

## 3. Sky Image Descriptor

The sky image descriptor (SID) leverages the Sky Finder dataset [1], which contains a rich variety of sky imagery. We manually categorized the 20 most relevant scenes into three distinct classes: clear, partial, and overcast, based on sky conditions. Using this classified data, we trained a ResNet50 backbone [2] with a multi-layer perceptron head. The model was trained on a contrastive learning task, enabling it to extract meaningful sky image representations from the diverse sky conditions present in the dataset.



### 3.1 Datasets

#### 3.1.1 Sky Finder Dataset

The Sky Finder dataset comprises high-resolution outdoor images captured across various locations, weather conditions, and times of day. Our preprocessing involves:

1. **Image Classification**: We manually categorized the 20 most representative scenes in the dataset into three classes based on sky visibility, yielding 21,490 images across the three classes:
    - **Clear**: (6,335 images) Scenes with predominantly visible blue sky and minimal cloud coverage.
    - **Partial**: (6,378 images) Scenes with mixed cloud and clear sky regions.
    - **Overcast**: (8,777 images) Scenes with complete or near-complete cloud coverage.
2. **Image Preprocessing**: Images are cropped based on manually labeled ground segmentation to remove non-sky regions, and then in-painted using TELEA algorithm [3] with a radius of 3 pixels to seamlessly fill any artifacts along the segmentation boundary.

For experimental evaluation, the dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets containing 12,894 (60%), 4,298 (20%), and 4,298 (20%) images, respectively.

#### 3.1.2 Pair Generation for Contrastive Learning

Our contrastive learning framework relies on creating meaningful sample pairs:

1. **Positive Pairs**: For each processed image in the dataset, we generate two different augmented views of the same base image. These views are created through a series of transformations aiming to keep the core content of the image intact while introducing variability.

2. **Negative Pairs**: All other augmented views from different base images in the batch serve as negative examples. The model learns to distinguish these from the positive pairs.

### 3.2 Model Architecture

#### 3.2.1 SID Backbone Network

The SID model employs a ResNet50 backbone pretrained on ImageNet [4] as the feature encoder, with the original classification head replaced by a projection head. The projection head consists of a two-layer multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with ReLU activation between layers, mapping the 2048-dimensional ResNet50 feature vector to a 16-dimensional SID space. The final descriptors are L2-normalized.

#### 3.2.2 Classification Head for Downstream Validation

To evaluate the quality of learned SID representations, we implement a simple classification head consisting of a 3-layer fully connected network. The architecture includes:

- **Input Layer**: Accepts 16-dimensional SID embeddings
- **Hidden Layers**: Two fully connected layers with ReLU activations.
- **Output Layer**: 3-way linear layer producing probabilities for clear, partial, and overcast sky conditions.

This lightweight classification head serves as a downstream task to validate that the learned SID representations capture semantically meaningful sky condition features.


### 3.3 Training Objective

#### 3.3.1 Contrastive Learning Objective

We employ the Normalized Temperature-scaled Cross Entropy (NT-Xent) loss, which is formulated as:

$$\mathcal{L} = -\log\frac{\exp(\text{sim}(z_i, z_j)/\tau)}{\sum_{k=1}^{2N}\mathbf{1}_{[k \neq i]}\exp(\text{sim}(z_i, z_k)/\tau)}$$

Where:
- $z_i$ and $z_j$ are normalized descriptors of two augmented views of the same image.
- $\text{sim}(u, v)$ denotes the cosine similarity between vectors $u$ and $v$.
- $\tau$ is a temperature parameter that controls the concentration level of the distribution.
- $N$ is the number of image pairs in the current batch.
- $\mathbf{1}_{[k \neq i]}$ is an indicator function that equals 1 when $k \neq i$.

This loss function encourages the model to learn representations where similar samples are pulled together in the descriptor space while dissimilar samples are pushed apart, resulting in a model that effectively captures the distinctive characteristics of different sky conditions.

#### 3.3.2 Classification Head Training Objective

The classification head is trained using standard cross-entropy loss:

$$L_{cls} = -\sum_{i=1}^{C} y_i \log(\hat{y}_i)$$

Where $C=3$ represents the number of sky condition classes, $y_i$ is the ground truth label, and $\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted probability for class $i$. The classification head is trained separately after the SID backbone has been trained and frozen.



### 3.4 Training Procedure

#### 3.4.1 SID Backbone Training

Our SID model was trained with the following hyperparameters and configuration:

- **Optimizer**: AdamW with a learning rate of $10^{-4}$ and weight decay of $10^{-4}$.
- **Embedding Dimension**: 16 (latent space dimension at the end of the MLP head).
- **Batch Configuration**: 2 batches with 3 pairs per batch ($N=3$).
- **Training Duration**: 4 epochs.
- **Temperature Parameter**: 0.5 for the NT-Xent loss.
- **Learning Rate Scheduler**: Reduce learning rate on plateau with a patience of 1 epoch and a factor of 0.5.
- **Hardware**: Single NVIDIA RTX 3080 GPU with 10GB of memory.

#### 3.4.2 Classification Head Training

The classification head training follows a standard supervised learning approach:

- **Optimizer**: AdamW with a learning rate of $10^{-3}$ and weight decay of $10^{-4}$.
- **Batch Size**: 32 images.
- **Training Duration**: 100 epochs with early stopping based on validation loss.
- **Learning Rate Scheduler**: Reduce learning rate on plateau with a patience of 1 epoch and a factor of 0.5.

These configurations provide a good balance between performance and computational efficiency, allowing the models to learn meaningful representations while remaining trainable on consumer-grade hardware.



### 3.5 Results

#### 3.5.1 Sky Image Descriptor Space Visualization

The trained SID model is evaluated on the Sky Finder dataset, and the results are visualized using UMAP [5]. The resulting plots demonstrate how the model effectively clusters similar sky conditions together in the descriptor space.

Figure 2a shows the sky image descriptor space visualization grouped by semantic sky class labels (clear, partial, overcast), revealing natural clustering of similar sky conditions. Remarkably, when applying unsupervised K-means clustering to the same descriptor space (Figures 2b-c), the resulting clusters closely follow the boundaries of the semantic sky classes. This alignment between unsupervised clustering and human-interpretable labels demonstrates that the SID model has learned meaningful representations that capture real physical and visual patterns in sky conditions without requiring explicit supervision during the descriptor extraction phase.

The K-means clustering reveals distinct patterns that correspond to recognizable sky characteristics. The rightmost cluster (blue in K=3, orange in K=4) centers on clear sky conditions, capturing images with predominantly blue skies and minimal cloud coverage. The bottom-center cluster (green in K=3, blue in K=4) focuses mostly on partially cloudy conditions and highly textured overcast skies, encompassing a diverse range of sky patterns from delicate veil clouds and scattered cumulus formations to heavily cloudy skies with significant texture variation.

In the K=3 clustering (Figure 2b), the remaining cluster primarily contains overcast skies. However, the K=4 clustering (Figure 2c) reveals a more nuanced structure by splitting overcast conditions into two distinct subclusters. The green cluster (leftmost region) centers around heavily and uniformly overcast skies with minimal texture variation, representing completely cloud-covered conditions or fog. In contrast, the red cluster (topmost region) captures overcast skies with more visual texture and contrast, likely including scenes where sky partially penetrates through cloud layers or where cloud formations exhibit greater structural variation. This finer granularity suggests that the SID representations encode subtle but meaningful differences in cloud density, texture, and spatial patterns that align with human visual perception of sky conditions.

#### 3.5.2 Downstream Classification Performance

To quantitatively validate the quality of the learned SID representations, we evaluate their performance on the downstream task of sky condition classification. The 16-dimensional SID embeddings are fed into the classification head described in Section 1.2.2, and the model is trained to predict the three sky condition classes.

The classification results demonstrate good performance across all evaluation metrics. The SID representations achieve over 86% accuracy on the test set with minimal performance degradation between training and test splits, indicating strong generalization capabilities. The high F1 scores across all splits confirm that the learned representations capture discriminative features that enable accurate sky condition classification, providing quantitative validation of the semantic clustering patterns observed in the UMAP visualizations.

<div align="center">
   <em><strong>Table 1:</strong> Classification performance of the SID-based sky condition classifier. Results demonstrate high accuracy and F1 scores across all data splits, validating the quality of learned representations.</em>
</div>

<div align="center">

| Metric | Training | Validation | Test |
|--------|----------|------------|------|
| **Accuracy** | 0.8609 | 0.8616 | 0.8637 |
| **F1 Score** | 0.8584 | 0.8561 | 0.8590 |

</div>

Analysis of the confusion matrix reveals interesting patterns in per-class performance. The clear sky class achieves the highest F1 score (0.9040), followed by overcast conditions (0.8904), while partial sky conditions show the lowest performance (0.7826). This performance disparity likely stems from the inherently ambiguous nature of partial sky conditions, which represent a transitional state between clear and overcast skies. The non-binary characteristics of partial conditions create classification challenges at decision boundaries, where distinguishing between clear-partial or overcast-partial transitions becomes ambiguous. This finding aligns with the expected difficulty in categorizing intermediate sky states and highlights the model's stronger performance on more distinctive sky conditions with clearer visual characteristics.

### 3.6 Plotting New Data in the SID Space

The SID space was built on the sky finder dataset, but new sky images can be projected into the SID space using the trained SID model. This allows for the visualization of new sky images in the same descriptor space, enabling comparison between new images or between sky finder manually labelled images.

#### 3.6.1 Window View Dataset

Adapting our own dataset of window views introduced in [6], we can pass the images through the SID model to obtain their sky image descriptors. The window view dataset contains 45 high-resolution images captured from fifteen different locations across the EPFL campus in Switzerland between March and May 2023, encompassing a wide range of atmospheric conditions including clear, partial, and overcast skies.

The images were captured using a calibrated Canon EOS R5 DSLR camera with dual fisheye lens at 6K resolution (6144×3072 pixels), then converted to 180-degree equirectangular projection format. To ensure physically accurate window view representation, each scene was captured alongside a 1:10 scale model of an office room with horizontal aperture. The capture locations maintained a minimum 6-meter distance from moving objects and aimed for balanced visual composition with approximately 25% greenery and 40% sky-to-window ratio, following European Daylight Standard EN17037 criteria.

This dataset was originally developed for virtual reality research investigating how dynamic versus static window view representations affect visual perception and building occupant experience. When processed through our trained SID model, these real-world window view images provide valuable validation of the sky image descriptor space learned from the Sky Finder dataset, enabling evaluation of how the model generalizes to practical architectural viewing scenarios.

#### 3.6.2 Methodology

To project new sky images into the trained SID space, we developed a processing pipeline that ensures consistent representation with the Sky Finder dataset. The methodology follows these sequential steps:

1. **Manual Image Cropping:** For images containing specific viewing contexts (e.g., window views), manual cropping can be applied to focus on the desired region. This step utilizes manually annotated binary masks to define the region of interest, ensuring that only relevant content is analyzed while excluding irrelevant elements.

2. **Sky Region Detection and Cropping:** The sky region is automatically segmented using Grounded Segment Anything 2 (GSAM2) [7] with the keyword prompt "sky". This state-of-the-art segmentation model provides accurate and robust segmentation of sky regions in images, even under challenging conditions such as varying lighting or atmospheric effects, and it eliminates the need for manual annotation of new datasets. Following segmentation, the image is automatically cropped to the bounding box of the detected sky region, removing non-sky areas and focusing the analysis on the relevant atmospheric content.

3. **Boundary Artifact Removal:** The cropped sky region undergoes inpainting using the TELEA algorithm with a radius of 3 pixels. This step removes segmentation boundary artifacts and ensures smooth transitions at mask boundaries, preserving the integrity of the sky region while eliminating potential artifacts that could affect descriptor quality.

#### 3.6.3 Results

The projection of window view images into the trained SID space demonstrates successful generalization of the learned sky descriptors to real-world architectural viewing scenarios. Figure 3 shows the UMAP visualization where the 42 window view images (represented as crosses) are distributed throughout the descriptor space alongside the Sky Finder dataset points.

The window view images exhibit meaningful spatial distribution within the established sky condition clusters. Clear sky conditions from the window views (blue crosses) predominantly map to the rightmost region of the descriptor space, aligning with the clear sky cluster learned from the Sky Finder dataset. Partial sky conditions (orange crosses) distribute primarily in the central regions, overlapping with the mixed cloud and clear sky patterns identified during training. Overcast conditions (red crosses) cluster in the left portion of the space, corresponding to the heavily clouded regions established by the original training data.

#### 3.7.6 Plotting New Data in the SID Space

To project new sky videos into the SID space, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare the new video dataset:** Ensure the new sky videos are in a compatible format (e.g., MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV) and stored in the [data/videos/processed](data/videos/processed) directory. The videos should contain visible sky regions for accurate descriptor extraction.

2. **Prepare the manually annotated masks:** If you have manually annotated masks for the new videos, place them in the [data/videos/masks](data/videos/masks) directory. This step is optional, typically used for datasets where specific regions of interest need to be focused on.

3. **Clone the Grounded Segment Anything 2 (GSAM2) repository:**

    ```bash
    cd src
    git clone https://github.com/IDEA-Research/Grounded-SAM-2.git
    ```

## 4. Cloud Coverage

The cloud coverage (CC) model provides a quantitative measure of sky conditions through pixel-level segmentation and aggregation. Using a U-Net architecture with a ResNet50 encoder backbone, the model performs dense prediction to estimate the proportion of cloud coverage for each sky pixel, outputting probability values between 0 and 1. The final cloud coverage percentage is computed by taking the spatial average of all sky pixel predictions, resulting in a single continuous value representing the overall cloud coverage for the entire sky region.



### 4.1 Datasets

#### 4.1.1 Sky Finder Cover Dataset

In this repository, we introduce the Sky Finder Cover Dataset, which is a manually annotated subset of the Sky Finder Dataset with pixel-level cloud segmentation masks. This carefully curated dataset maintains the same classification schema (clear, partial, and overcast) as the original Sky Finder Dataset, providing high-quality ground truth for cloud segmentation tasks.

The dataset was created through a meticulous annotation process where representative images were selected from each sky condition category to ensure diversity across weather conditions, times of day, and cloud formations. Annotators then created pixel-precise masks, where each pixel is labeled as either cloud-covered (white), partially covered (gray) or clear sky/ground (black). Special attention was given to cloud boundaries and transitional regions to ensure accurate coverage estimation.

For experimental evaluation, the dataset was divided into training and validation sets containing 182 and 58 images, respectively, maintaining representative distributions across all sky condition classes.

#### 4.1.2 Sky Finder Active Dataset

To address the limited size of manually annotated data, we implement an active learning framework that leverages high-confidence pseudo-labels from the broader Sky Finder dataset.

A cloud coverage model was first trained on the manually annotated Sky Finder Cover Dataset using the architecture and training procedure described in Sections 2.2 and 2.4. The trained model was then systematically applied to unlabeled images from the full Sky Finder Dataset, where prediction uncertainty was quantified using pixel-wise entropy measurements across the segmentation output. Through this uncertainty quantification process, only predictions exhibiting low entropy were selected as pseudo-labels, ensuring quality control through confidence-based filtering. This threshold-based selection mechanism effectively retained only the most confident predictions for training augmentation, maintaining annotation quality while significantly expanding the available training data.

This active learning approach expands the training set with 359 high-confidence pseudo-labeled images and the validation set with 128 additional pseudo-labeled images, significantly increasing the available training data while maintaining annotation quality through automated confidence filtering.



### 4.2 Model Architecture

The CC model employs a U-Net [8] architecture with a ResNet50 backbone pretrained on ImageNet serving as the feature encoder. This encoder-decoder structure is specifically designed for dense prediction tasks, making it well-suited for pixel-level cloud segmentation.

**Encoder (ResNet50 Backbone):** The ResNet50 encoder progressively downsamples input images while extracting hierarchical features at multiple scales. The pretrained weights provide robust low-level feature representations that transfer effectively to sky imagery, capturing edges, textures, and structural patterns essential for cloud boundary detection.

**Decoder with Skip Connections:** The decoder consists of upsampling blocks that progressively restore spatial resolution through bilinear interpolation followed by convolutional layers. Skip connections from corresponding encoder levels are concatenated with decoder features at each resolution level, preserving fine-grained spatial information essential for accurate cloud boundary delineation.

**Dual-Output Design:** The architecture incorporates two complementary outputs to enhance learning:
1. **Primary Segmentation Output:** Pixel-wise cloud coverage estimation through the standard U-Net segmentation head, producing a probability map where each pixel represents the likelihood of cloud coverage.

2. **Auxiliary Classification Branch:** A secondary convolutional branch processes feature maps before the final segmentation layer to output a single scalar value between 0 and 1, representing overall sky condition intensity (0 for clear, 0.5 for partial, 1 for overcast).

This auxiliary branch provides additional supervisory signal during training, enables evaluation of global sky classification accuracy, and enforces consistency between pixel-level predictions and image-level sky conditions, resulting in more robust and interpretable cloud coverage estimates.



### 4.3 Training Objective

The training objective combines three complementary loss functions to optimize both segmentation accuracy and classification consistency:

$$\mathcal{L} = 0.5 \cdot \mathcal{L}\_{F} + 0.5 \cdot \mathcal{L}\_{D} + 0.1 \cdot \mathcal{L}\_{B}$$

The focal loss ($\mathcal{L}_{F}$) addresses class imbalance and focuses learning on difficult examples:

$$\mathcal{L}_{F} = -\alpha(1-p_t)^\gamma\log(p_t)$$

Where $p_t$ is the predicted probability for the true class, $\alpha=0.5$ balances class importance, and $\gamma=2.0$ down-weights easy examples, forcing the model to focus on challenging cloud boundaries and ambiguous regions.

The dice loss ($\mathcal{L}_{D}$) optimizes spatial overlap between predicted and ground truth segmentations:

$$\mathcal{L}\_{D} = 1 - \frac{2\sum\_{i=1}^{N}p_i g_i}{\sum\_{i=1}^{N}p_i^2 + \sum\_{i=1}^{N}g_i^2 + \epsilon}$$

Where $p_i$ and $g_i$ are predicted and ground truth probabilities for pixel $i$, $N$ is the total number of pixels, and $\epsilon$ ensures numerical stability. This loss is particularly effective for segmentation tasks as it directly optimizes the overlap metric used for evaluation.

For the auxiliary classification branch, binary cross-entropy loss ($\mathcal{L}_{\text{BCE}}$) provides supervision using image-level sky condition labels:

$$\mathcal{L}_{B} = -[y \log(\hat{y}) + (1-y) \log(1-\hat{y})]$$

Where $y$ is the ground truth sky condition class and $\hat{y}$ is the predicted classification score. This ensures consistency between pixel-level and image-level predictions.



### 4.4 Training Procedure

- **Optimizer:** AdamW with learning rate $10^{-4}$ and weight decay $10^{-4}$.
- **Batch Size:** 2 images per batch.
- **Training Duration:** 100 epochs.

#### 4.5.2 SID Space Visualization with Cloud Coverage

To understand the relationship between learned sky representations and cloud coverage estimates, we visualized the Sky Image Descriptor (SID) space colored by predicted cloud coverage values. This analysis reveals important insights about model performance and limitations.

<div align="center">
  <img src="generated/sky_image_descriptor_space/sky_image_descriptor_space_cloud_cover.png" alt="SID Space with Cloud Coverage" width="90%">
  <br>
  <em><strong>Figure 4:</strong> UMAP visualization of the Sky Image Descriptor space colored by predicted cloud coverage values. Dark blue represents clear skies (low coverage), while yellow represents overcast conditions (high coverage).</em>
</div>

The visualization demonstrates clear performance patterns across different sky conditions, with the model performing exceptionally well for clear sky conditions in the rightmost cluster, consistently predicting low cloud coverage values (dark blue) that align with ground truth expectations. Moving toward more complex conditions, overcast skies with significant visual texture and structure in the upper center regions show successful high cloud coverage identification, while the central regions exhibit smooth gradations in cloud coverage estimates that effectively capture the transitional nature of partial sky conditions with appropriate intermediate values. However, a critical limitation emerges in the leftmost cluster, where uniform overcast skies with minimal texture variation display inconsistent cloud coverage predictions, showing a problematic tendency to estimate low coverage values (dark blue) despite representing heavily clouded conditions that should yield consistently high coverage estimates.

The observed performance disparity in uniform overcast conditions can be attributed to several fundamental challenges that highlight the inherent limitations of sky-only analysis. During manual annotation, human annotators naturally incorporated contextual cues from ground regions to assess sky conditions, utilizing ground shadows, ambient lighting conditions, and overall scene brightness as critical indicators of atmospheric conditions that are completely unavailable when analyzing isolated sky regions. This information loss is compounded by the model's inherent texture dependency, as uniform overcast skies often lack the distinctive structural features and spatial variation patterns that the model relies upon for accurate segmentation. Furthermore, lighting ambiguity creates additional classification challenges, as uniform conditions encompass a wide spectrum of scenarios ranging from bright days with thin, diffuse cloud cover to dark, heavily clouded conditions that can appear visually similar despite representing vastly different levels of actual cloud density and coverage.

## 5. Optical Flow

Optical flow analysis captures the dynamic characteristics of sky conditions by quantifying pixel-level motion patterns between consecutive video frames. This temporal descriptor provides insights into cloud movement, atmospheric dynamics, and weather transitions that are impossible to capture from static images alone, serving as a complementary feature to the appearance-based Sky Image Descriptors.



### 5.1 Methodology

We employ the Farneback optical flow algorithm implemented in OpenCV to compute dense optical flow fields between consecutive frames sampled at 3-second intervals in sky videos. The Farneback method estimates motion by analyzing the displacement of intensity patterns between frames, making it well-suited for capturing cloud movement and atmospheric dynamics without requiring feature tracking.

For each video sequence, we extract the mean optical flow magnitude across all sky pixels as the primary temporal descriptor, providing a single scalar value that quantifies the overall motion intensity in the sky region.



### 5.2 Results

#### 5.2.1 Optical Flow Magnitude in SID Space

To understand the relationship between sky appearance and motion characteristics, we Figure 5 shows the SID space colored by optical flow magnitude values from our 45 window view scenes. This analysis reveals the distribution of motion patterns across different sky conditions and their correspondence with the learned appearance representations.

<div align="center">

  <br>
  <em><strong>Figure 5:</strong> UMAP visualization of the Sky Image Descriptor space colored by optical flow magnitude.

  ).</em>
</div>

The visualization reveals clear trends in optical flow magnitude distribution across the SID space that align with the physical characteristics of different sky conditions. Clear skies in the rightmost cluster typically exhibit low optical flow values (dark blue), as these uniform conditions lack moving visual features that would generate significant motion patterns. Similarly, the upper left region of the SID space, which corresponds to uniform overcast and foggy conditions as identified in previous analysis, also shows predominantly low optical flow magnitudes due to the homogeneous, static nature of these atmospheric conditions. In contrast, the highest optical flow magnitudes appear in regions corresponding to overcast and partial sky conditions with higher visual contrast, where distinct cloud formations create clearly differentiated patterns against the sky background. These structured cloud environments generate substantial motion patterns as cloud formations move across the sky due to wind and changing atmospheric conditions, resulting in the elevated optical flow values observed in these intermediate regions of the SID space.
